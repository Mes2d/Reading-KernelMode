# My-old-driver-
This repository contains a basic Windows kernel-mode driver built using the Windows Driver Framework (WDF) for handling read and write operations on a specific device. The driver is designed to interact with a hardware device, managing read requests to retrieve data (such as serial numbers) and write requests to update or modify device information.
