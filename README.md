# Kernel-Mode Driver for Device Interaction
This repository contains a basic Windows kernel-mode driver built using the Windows Driver Framework (WDF) for handling read and write operations on a specific device. The driver is designed to interact with a hardware device, managing read requests to retrieve data (such as serial numbers) and write requests to update or modify device information.

# Key Features:
- Device Interaction: Supports read and write operations to and from the managed device.
- WDF Framework: Utilizes the Windows Driver Framework for robust and efficient driver development.
- Sample Read Operation: Demonstrates handling read requests by obtaining a serial number from hardware.
- Sample Write Operation: Handles write requests by printing received data.

## 1. Build Environment
Set up a Windows Kernel Mode Driver development environment using [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and download the [Windows Driver Kit (WDK)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) to develop kernel drivers.

## 2. Device Integration
Customize `ReadSerialNumberFromHardware` in the code for your specific hardware. This function is responsible for reading data from the hardware device.

## 3. Enhancements
Extend the provided code to meet the specific requirements of your device. This may include additional functionality, improved error handling, or other customizations.
